\chapter{Week 3 - Transistors}

We implemented a simplific interface for the transistor exercise. All controls are operated through a right click menu, except for the \textit{drag and drop} function to move the circuits (which is done by moving the mouse while the left click is pressed).

The source code for this exercise is in the file \texttt{Week04/Transistor.cpp}
