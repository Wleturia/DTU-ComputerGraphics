  \section{Week 08}

    After implementing the requested functions we had the result shown in
    image \ref{img:Week08}. The requested code can be seen in listing
    \ref{lst:0809}

  \section{Week 09}

    We implemented the reflections of the teapot on the plane quad, as seen in figure \ref{img:AllRef} and
    \ref{img:AllRef2}.
    Do to this we had to invert the winding rule for the triangles, because in the process
    of drawing the reflection we need to invert the coordinates along the Y axis, which
    changes the winding order of the triangles and due to the backface culling we would have
    seen the backfaces of the mesh instead of the front ones in the reflection. Another solution
    would have been to disable the backface culling, but this would have ment to loose an
    optimisation.
